# Adult-Dataset-Visualization
# Predicting Income Levels Using Demographic Data

## Description
This project uses the Adult dataset, extracted by Barry Beckers from the 1994 census database and submitted to UCI. The dataset is a survey of about 50,000 people with 15 features:

1. Age
2. Workclass
3. Fnlwgt
4. Education
5. Education-num
6. Marital-status
7. Occupation
8. Relationship
9. Race
10. Sex
11. Capital-gain
12. Capital-loss
13. Hours-per-week
14. Native-country
15. Income (Target Variable)

The primary goal is to determine how factors like age, education, marital status, and others affect a person's income prediction. This information can be used to understand the overall positive and negative effects on personal finances, which could then impact the growth of the nation. We are attempting to understand the relationships between the features and the impact they have on our target variable. 

## Objective
Our major objectives were to answer the following questions:
1. What is the relationship between marital status and various age groups?
2. How does a person's salary depend on their level of education?
3. What is the impact of gender on income levels?
4. What is the effect of occupation and weekly labor hours on income levels?

## Results
The results of the analysis showed several key trends and patterns. For example, the dataset is highly biased towards the United States, accounting for approximately 92% of the surveyed population. Additionally, people over 65 have the highest capital gains and often an income exceeding $50,000. Other key findings are detailed in the report.

## Conclusion
The project concluded with several key findings:
1. People over 65 have the highest capital gains, and their income often exceeds $50,000. This could be due to the fact that at this age, people have settled into their lives, have no debt, and start to qualify for tax exemptions.
2. The majority of people begin working as soon as they graduate from college or even high school. This results in fewer students with higher degree levels, which contributes to higher salary levels among those with bachelor's degrees.
3. Employees in the executive, management, and sales fields have the highest earning potential and work the most hours each week. Although craft repair requires long hours of work, the capital gain is not very significant for these workers.
4. Divorced individuals without children and married individuals with civilian wives have the highest average financial gains.
